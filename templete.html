        <p class="paragraf">Programming is the process of composing instructions or commands written in a language that can be understood by a computer.
            Each of these instructions will tell the computer what to do to achieve a goal or complete a specific task, such as calculations, data processing, to application or game development.
            Programming is done using various programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, and others.
            These languages ​​have special rules and structures called syntax, which allow the computer to understand the instructions given by the programmer.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraf">In the programming process, there are several main steps that are generally followed. First, the programmer must understand
                 the problem or need that they want to solve. Next, they design a solution, write code, and test the program they created to ensure that the code runs correctly and is error-free.
                  Once the program is running properly, the final step is maintenance, which is updating and fixing the code when new needs arise or errors are found.</p>
            <p class="paragraf">Programming allows us to create various applications that are useful in everyday life, such as banking applications, data management systems,
                 and social media platforms. With programming, we can maximize the potential of computers as tools that can complete tasks automatically, efficiently, and quickly.</p>
            
            <h3 class="mb-5"><li>HTML</li></h3>
            <p class="paragraf">
                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to create the basic structure of a web page. HTML allows us to add various elements such as text, images, tables, links,
                and videos to a web page, so that it can be displayed properly in a browser. With HTML, developers can define a hierarchy of information, such as titles, subtitles, and paragraphs,
                 which makes it easier for users to understand the contents of a page.</p>

            <p class="paragraf">HTML works by arranging elements using tags, each of which
                 has a specific function. For example, the h1 to h6 tags are used to create
                headings or titles, while p is used for paragraphs of text. There are also
                tags such as a to create hyperlinks and img to display images. The basic
                 structure of HTML usually begins with the !DOCTYPE html declaration, which
                  indicates that the document uses HTML5, followed by the html, head, 
                  and body elements that form the framework of the HTML document.</p>

            <p class="paragraf">In addition, HTML is often combined with CSS (Cascading
                 Style Sheets) to set the visual appearance and JavaScript to add 
                 interactivity. HTML acts as a framework, while CSS is responsible for the
                 design and aesthetics of the page. Meanwhile, JavaScript allows the web
                  page to interact with the user, making the experience more dynamic and
                   responsive. The combination of the three is the foundation of modern
                    web development, creating web pages that are not only functional but
                     also visually appealing.</p>
            
            <h3 class="mb-5"><li>CSS</li></h3>
            <p class="paragraf">CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style
                the appearance of elements in HTML and XML documents. Introduced by Håkon
                Wium Lie on October 10, 1994 at CERN, CSS allows for the separation of content
                from presentation, making it easier to develop and maintain websites.</p>
            <p class="paragraf">The first version, CSS1, was released by the W3C in 1996,
                 followed by CSS2 in 1998 and CSS3 which was introduced in 2011. CSS3
                introduced new modules such as Flexbox and Grid Layout, increasing the
                flexibility of responsive design across devices.</p>
            <p class="paragraf"></p>
            
            <h3 class="mb-5"><li>JavaScript</li></h3>
            <p class="paragraf">JavaScript is a programming language focused on web development
                and is often used to add dynamic features to web pages. Along with HTML and CSS,
                JavaScript is part of the main foundation of web development. JavaScript runs
                directly in the user's browser, allowing developers to create interactive and
                responsive web pages without having to reload the entire page. This creates a
                smoother and faster user experience, especially with interactive elements such
                as forms, animations, and media controls.</p>

            <p class="paragraf">In addition to being used on the client side, JavaScript can also
                function on the server side using technologies such as Node.js. This makes it even
                more flexible and allows developers to create full-stack applications with a single
                language, from the backend to the frontend. Thanks to its diverse capabilities,
                JavaScript has a rich ecosystem of frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular,
                and Vue.js, which speed up the creation of complex web applications with a mor organized structure.</p>

            <p class="paragraf">JavaScript also supports asynchronous programming, which allows 
                for efficient data processing without hampering application performance. With 
                features such as promises and async/await, JavaScript is able to handle operations 
                such as calling data from the server without waiting long. This makes JavaScript a 
                top choice for developers who want to build modern, responsive web applications with 
                better user interaction.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-5"><li>PHP</li></h3>
            <p class="paragraf">PHP, or Hypertext Preprocessor, is an open-source
                 programming language used to develop dynamic and interactive web
                  applications. PHP can be run on a server and is often combined
                   with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive web pages.</p>

            <p class="paragraf">This language was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.
                Initially, PHP was used to track visitors on his website, before
                evolving into a more complex tool for web development. Today, PHP
                is one of the most popular programming languages ​​in the world, used
                by many large sites such as Facebook and Wikipedia.</p>
            <p class="paragraf"></p>
            
            <h3 class="mb-5"><li>note js</li></h3>
            <p class="paragraf">Node.js is a runtime environment built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Designed to allow JavaScript code to be executed outside of the browser, Node.js allows developers to run JavaScript on the server. This makes JavaScript not only limited to client-side development, but also allows for building fast and scalable server-side applications. Node.js is very popular in web application development, especially applications that require high scalability and real-time.</p>
            <p class="paragraf">One of the main features of Node.js is its use of a non-blocking and event-driven I/O model. This means that Node.js can handle many connections simultaneously without having to wait for one connection to complete before moving on to another. This makes Node.js very efficient in handling applications that require many simultaneous connections, such as chat applications or data streaming applications. With this architecture, Node.js can handle hundreds of thousands of simultaneous connections with little overhead.</p>
            <p class="paragraf">Node.js also has a very large ecosystem thanks to npm (Node Package Manager), which provides thousands of open-source packages that can be used to speed up application development. These packages cover a wide range of functionality, from database management to middleware for handling HTTP requests. This way, developers can easily integrate various solutions into their applications without having to write code from scratch. As a result, Node.js has become the go-to choice for building modern applications, especially those based on microservices and real-time architectures.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-5"><li>python</li></h3>
            <p class="paragraf">Python is a high-level programming language created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991. Designed to prioritize code readability and syntax simplicity, Python is easy to learn for beginners and professionals alike. The name "Python" was inspired by the TV show Monty Python, a favorite of van Rossum, reflecting the relaxed yet powerful approach to language design.</p>
            <p class="paragraf">Today, Python is used in a wide range of applications, including web development with frameworks like Django and Flask, data analysis with libraries like pandas and NumPy, and artificial intelligence with tools like TensorFlow and scikit-learn. With a large community and broad support for libraries, Python continues to be one of the most popular programming languages ​​in the world.</p>
            <p class="paragraf"></p>
            
            <h3 class="mb-5"><li>java</li></h3>
            <p class="paragraf">Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have few implementation dependencies. Created by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems, Java was introduced in 1995 with the motto "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA). This concept allows Java code compiled into bytecode to run on multiple platforms without the need for recompilation, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Key features of Java include support for object-oriented programming, strong security, and multithreading capabilities.</p>
            <p class="paragraf">Java is widely used in a variety of fields, including web application development with frameworks such as Spring, mobile applications on Android, and embedded systems and the Internet of Things (IoT). With a large community and many libraries and frameworks available, Java remains one of the most popular programming languages ​​in the world today.</p>
            <p class="paragraf"></p>

            <h3 class="mb-5"><li>c++</li></h3>
            <p class="paragraf">C++ is a programming language developed as an extension of the C language, with the addition of object-oriented programming (OOP) features. It is designed to support structured and efficient software development, allowing code reuse through the concept of classes and objects. </p>
            <p class="paragraf">C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983. This language is known for its flexibility and is used in a variety of applications, including system development, software, and games</p>
            <p class="paragraf"></p>
            
            
            <h3 class="mb-5"><li>SQL</li></h3>
            <p class="paragraf">SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a programming language used to manage and manipulate data in relational database systems.
                SQL allows users to perform operations such as adding, changing, and deleting data, as well as organizing the structure of the database.</p>
            <p class="paragraf">SQL was first developed in the 1970s by IBM, originally known as SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language). This name was 
                later changed to SQL for ease of spelling and was adopted as a standard by ANSI in 1986 and ISO in 1987</p>
            <p class="paragraf"></p>

            <h3 class="mb-5"><li>c#</li></h3>
            <p class="paragraf">C# is a programming language designed for application development on the .NET platform. Created by Anders Hejlsberg and introduced by Microsoft in 2000, C# combines features from programming languages ​​such as C++ and Java, with a focus on ease of use and rapid development. The language supports object-oriented programming (OOP) and offers features such as automatic garbage collection, efficient memory management, and support for inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.</p>
            <p class="paragraf">C# is often used in the development of desktop, web, and game applications. With its simple syntax and high modularity, C# allows developers to create reusable code. In addition, C# has strong support for a wide range of application types, including Windows-based applications and web applications with ASP.NET. Security is also a major focus in the design of C#, with features that help prevent common programming errors.</p>

            </div>

            <h3 class="mb-5"><li>IP</li></h3>
            <p class="paragraf">Internet Protocol (IP) is a rule or protocol that defines how devices on a computer network communicate and exchange data. In this communication process, each device requires a unique identity called an IP address. This address acts like a home address that allows data to be sent and received from a particular device on the network. As the number of devices connected to the internet grows, IP becomes the basis for keeping communication between devices organized and reliable.</p>
            <p class="paragraf">IP addresses consist of two main versions, namely IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4, which was introduced first, uses a 32-bit format represented by four decimal numbers separated by dots, for example 192.168.1.1. However, with the rapid development of technology, the number of addresses available on IPv4 began to be insufficient, because it only supports around 4.3 billion unique addresses. As a result, the need arose for a new version that has a larger capacity.</p>
            <p class="paragraf">IPv6 is here as a solution to overcome the limitations of IPv4. IPv6 uses a 128-bit format, which dramatically increases the number of available IP addresses by trillions of times, meeting the needs of many devices in the future. The IPv6 format consists of eight groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. This allows for wider use amidst the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, where each device requires its own IP address.</p>
            <p class="paragraf">IP functions not only for identification, but also facilitates the sending of data between devices over the internet network. Every time a device sends data, the IP addresses of the sender and recipient are included in the data, so that the network can direct the data to the right destination. By using IP, the internet can connect millions of devices around the world, from computers, mobile phones, to IoT devices, and enable efficient communication across complex networks.</p>
            
            <h3 class="mb-5"><li>Router</li></h3>
            <p class="paragraf">A router is a networking device that connects two or more computer networks, whether local area networks (LAN) or wide area networks (WAN). It operates by forwarding data packets between these networks based on the destination IP address found in the packet header. When a router receives a data packet, it reads the address information, searches for the best route in its routing table, and directs the packet to its intended destination. Routers are crucial for managing data traffic on the internet, enabling various devices to connect and communicate efficiently. Their ability to link different types of networks and manage data flow makes routers essential components of modern communications infrastructure.</p>
            <p class="paragraf">The invention of the router cannot be attributed to a single individual but is instead a result of technological advances in networking that began in the 1960s. A key pioneer in this field was Leonard Kleinrock, who contributed to the theory of packet switching, which underpins router functionality. Additionally, engineers involved in ARPANET—the early internet project funded by the U.S. Department of Defense—played a significant role in developing the first routers that facilitated communication between computers. Over time, companies like Cisco and Juniper Networks have advanced router technology, creating devices with increasingly sophisticated features that are vital for today's computer networks.</p>
            <p class="paragraf"></p>
            
            <h3 class="mb-5"><li>switch</li></h3>
            <p class="paragraf">A switch is a network device that functions to connect several devices in a local area network (LAN) and forward data packets between the devices. Unlike a hub that simply forwards data to all ports, a switch uses a MAC address to identify the destination device and only sends data to the appropriate port. In this way, switches increase network efficiency by reducing congestion and allowing simultaneous communication between devices. Switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, although some switches can also function at the network layer (Layer 3) with additional routing capabilities.</p>
            <p class="paragraf">Although there is no single inventor for switch technology, its initial development was pioneered by engineers at various technology companies in the late 1980s. One of the pioneers in the development of switches was the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), which introduced the basic concept of switching in networking. Over time, companies such as Cisco and Juniper Networks have developed various types of switches with more advanced features, making them an important component of modern network infrastructure. Switches are now a key element in building efficient and reliable networks, whether in a home environment, a small office, or a large data center.</p>
            <p class="paragraf"></p>
            
            <h3 class="mb-5"><li>VPN</li></h3>
            <p class="paragraf">VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is a technology that allows users to create a secure, encrypted internet connection over a public network. Using a VPN, data sent between the user’s device and the VPN server is encrypted, making it difficult for third parties to access. This provides additional privacy and security when surfing the internet, especially over unsecured public networks. VPNs also allow users to access geographically restricted content and keep their online identity anonymous by hiding their real IP address. There are different types of VPNs, including Remote Access VPN and Site-to-Site VPN, each of which has specific functions and uses in both business and personal contexts.</p>
            <p class="paragraf">While there is no single inventor of VPN technology, its early development was pioneered by engineers at various institutions and companies in the 1990s. One of the key figures in the development of VPNs was Gurdeep Singh-Pall, who created the PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) protocol in 1996 while working at Microsoft. This protocol became one of the earliest methods for implementing a VPN connection. Over time, many other protocols have been developed to improve the security and efficiency of VPNs, including L2TP, IPsec, and OpenVPN, making them an essential tool for individual users and businesses to protect their data in the digital age.</p>
            <p class="paragraf"></p>
            
            <h3 class="mb-5"><li>Wi-Fi</li></h3>
            <p class="paragraf"> WiFi, which stands for Wireless Fidelity, is a wireless networking technology that allows devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets to connect to the internet without using cables. WiFi works by using radio waves to transmit data between devices and routers, so users can access the internet easily in various locations, whether at home, office, or public places. This technology has become an integral part of everyday life, enabling fast and efficient connectivity in today's digital age. The initial protocols underlying WiFi stem from the development of earlier wireless communication systems in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
            <p class="paragraf">The basic invention of WiFi can be attributed to Hedy Lamarr, a Hollywood actress who was also a genius inventor. Together with composer George Antheil, Lamarr developed a communication system known as "frequency hopping" in 1942, which allowed for the secure transmission of radio signals by hopping between various frequencies. Although their invention was not widely recognized at the time, this technology became the foundation for many modern communication systems, including WiFi. Hedy Lamarr was later dubbed the "Mother of WiFi" for her significant contributions in the development of the wireless technology we enjoy today. In 2014, she was officially recognized by being inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for her innovation.</p>
